<CLASS_NAME>Self Help Book Club (1st Year MFA Exhibition) - Opening</CLASS_NAME>
<LOCATION>Thomas Welton Stanford Art Gallery</LOCATION>
<START_TIME/>
<IMG_URL>http://events.stanford.edu/events/213/21389/1970.12_Kleophon_180w.jpg</IMG_URL>
<DESCRIPTION>The Department of Art &amp; Art History is pleased to present “Self Help Book Club” on view on January 17–February 26, with a reception on January 20, 5:30-7:30 PM at the Thomas Welton Stanford Art Gallery. This exhibition features new works created by five first year MFA students. Ben Bigelow, Chris Duncan, Terry Powers, Greg Stimac, and Dawn Weleski present a body of work in diverse media – 16mm film, video, painting, installation, and collaborative performance – and each artist takes a familiar medium and pushes the possibilities of content, presentation, and methodology.

In The Lonesome Foghorn Blows, Ben Bigelow excavates an elusive Americana of the psyche through a rhythmic video tryptic.  

Chris Duncan plays with scale and vertigo in a large, 14 ft x 14 ft celestial painting called Painting 2011 that challenges the viewer’s perception of space.

Terry Powers’ two large paintings on canvas depict his introspective forays into painterly narrative that attempt to resist interpretation.

Greg Stimac has abandoned his usual road trip to explore an American icon through his virtual travels of the U.S.

Dawn Weleski travels far afield to create an interactive and participatory work derived from remnants gathered during an artist residency that took her to Tahrir Square in Cairo.</DESCRIPTION>

<CLASS_NAME>The Legend of Rex Slinkard</CLASS_NAME>
<LOCATION>Cantor Arts Center</LOCATION>
<START_TIME/>
<IMG_URL>http://events.stanford.edu/events/298/29859/Cooper.jpg</IMG_URL>
<DESCRIPTION>The Cantor Arts Center is the primary repository of paintings and sketches by the early twentieth-century California artist, Rex Slinkard, who survived military service in World War I but succumbed to the influenza epidemic of 1918.  During his too­–brief life he emerged from his roots as a California rancher to become a painter who helped influence the modernist bent of the nascent California art scene. 

Slinkard studied with Robert Henri and shared a studio with George Bellows in New York City, returning to paint and teach in Los Angeles where he established personal contacts with well-known people in the worlds of visual and literary arts.  

This selection of oil paintings, charcoal drawings, and small pen-and-watercolor sketches was/has been chosen for visual strength and to convey the breadth of his short-lived artistic development and his range of subject matter.
