<NAME>PRISTIQ</NAME>
<DESCRIPTION>Pristiq (desvenlafaxine) is used to treat major depressive disorder in adults, and is believed to work on two chemicals in the brain, serotonin and norepinephrine. In contrast to many other antidepressants that must be started at a low dose and titrated up to a therapeutic dose, Pristiq patients can start at a dose proven to relieve depression symptoms: 50 mg, one pill, once a day. In addition, Pristiq does not undergo CYP2D6 metabolism in the liver, thereby reducing the risks of pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction with other medications that do need to be metabolized through this important enzyme system.</DESCRIPTION>
