Oracle Data Mining provides a powerful, state-of-the-art data mining capability within Oracle Database. You can use Oracle Data Mining to build and deploy predictive and descriptive data mining applications, to add intelligent capabilities to existing applications, and to generate predictive queries for data exploration.
[br/][br/]
Oracle Data Mining offers a comprehensive set of in-database algorithms for performing a variety of mining tasks, such as classification, regression, anomaly detection, feature extraction, clustering, and market basket analysis. The algorithms can work on standard case data, transactional data, star schemas, and text and other forms of unstructured data. Oracle Data Mining is uniquely suited to the mining of very large data sets.

There are several examples of Data Miner workflows included in OBIEE SampleApp V406 Virtual Image. You can view these examples from SQL Developer which is pre-installed on the image. Look for these examples under the Data Miner tab. Note: If the Data Miner tab is not open, select View &gt; Data Miner &gt; Data Miner Connections from the SQL Develper main menu.

A Data Miner Workflow is a collection of connected nodes that describe a data mining processes. A workflow:[br/]
[br/]o	Provides directions for the Data Mining server. For example, the workflow says &quot;Build a model with these characteristics&quot;. The model is built by the data mining server with the results returned to the workflow.
[br/]o	Enables you to interactively build, analyze, and test a data mining process within a graphical environment.
[br/]o	May be used to test and analyze only one cycle within a particular phase of a larger process, or it may encapsulate all phases of a process designed to solve a particular business problem.
