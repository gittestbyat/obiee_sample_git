[u][b]Introduction[/b][/u][br/][br/]
The look and feel of the user interface in Oracle BI EE is controlled by skins and styles. Skins define the user interface chrome (visible graphic features) outside the home and dashboard area.
[br/]
Oracle BI EE ships with several styles, such as Skyros, blafp (browser look and feel), and FusionFX (fusion applications).
You can control the way that the interface for Oracle BI EE is displayed to users by creating skins and styles. [br/]
The primary difference between skins and styles is that styles only apply to dashboard content, whereas skins apply to every other part of the user interface.
For example, within Oracle BI EE, skins apply to components that are used in analyses and scorecarding.
[br/][br/]
[b]NOTE:-[/b] In Oracle BI Presentation Services, you customize the user interface elements and appearance by modifying styles and skins, not with JavaScript. 
You do not modify JavaScript files that are located in the ORACLE_HOME\bifoundation\web\appv2\res directory. 
This is because the objects and methods in these scripts might change, and because these files might be replaced when upgrading.
